## Overview
The **Bank Management System** is a web-based application developed using **Spring Boot** to automate and streamline various banking processes. The system includes managing customer accounts, performing transactions, ensuring secure access, and much more. It helps banks reduce manual tasks, improve efficiency, and provide a better customer experience.

---

## Features
* **Customer Account Management**: Create, view, update, and delete customer accounts.
* **Transaction Management**: Perform transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers securely.
* **User Authentication**: Secure login for different users (e.g., admins, customers).
* **Account Summary**: View account balance and recent transactions.
* **Error Handling & Logging**: Centralized error handling and logging with proper validation mechanisms.
  
---

## Technology Stack
* **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Maven
* **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, Bootstrap
* **Database**: MySQL
* **Security**: Spring Security, BCrypt Encryption
* **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
* **Build Tools**: Spring Boot Maven Plugin

---

## Architecture
The project follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:
* **Model**: Represents the data and business logic (entities and services).
* **View**: Handled by Thymeleaf for rendering HTML pages.
* **Controller**: Manages the flow of the application, handles HTTP requests, and sends responses.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites:
* Java 17
* Maven
* MySQL
* Spring Boot 3.3.2 or higher

### Installation Steps:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bank-management-system
   ```
3. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bankdb
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   ```
4. Install Maven dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage
* **Admin** can manage customer accounts, view transaction history, and approve loans.
* **Customer** can log in to their accounts, check balances, perform transactions, and view account statements.

### Access the Application
Once the application is running, access it at:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Database
The project uses **MySQL** as its database to store customer information, including account details, transaction history, and user credentials. The database schema includes the following tables:
* `accounts`: Stores customer account information (account number, balance, etc.).
* `transactions`: Records transaction details (type, amount, timestamp).
* `users`: Holds user credentials and roles for authentication.

---

## Testing
Unit tests have been implemented using **JUnit** and **Mockito** for key service methods, including:
* Account creation
* Transaction processing
* Authentication and authorization

To run tests, use:
```bash
mvn test
```

---

## Future Enhancements
Some potential future improvements include:
* **Loan Management**: Add a module to apply for, approve, and manage loans.
* **Mobile App Integration**: Create a mobile app version using a REST API for remote banking.
* **Multi-Currency Support**: Enable transactions in multiple currencies for international banking.
